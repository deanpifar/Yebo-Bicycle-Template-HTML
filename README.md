# Yebo Bicycle Template HTML
There is another HTML version of this template made by [Peter Finlan](https://github.com/peterfinlan/Yebo-Bicycle-Template), and while the design stayed mostly identical, the code is much different. He used frameworks such as Bootstrap, Animate.css, FancyBox, FlexSlider in his template while I haven't used any. So if you preffer using frameworks such as Bootstrap you might want to check his version as well. But I would strongly encourage everyone to use my version since the code is much cleaner and lightweight.

*Keep in mind that I did change quite a bit of code after initial relase of the video and template. So the timelapse is not relevant as it used to be.*
